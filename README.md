# Deep Human Activity Recognition
As part of my [PhD project](http://www.cachet.dk/research/projects/motivating-physical-activity) I am estimating personal energy expenditure from smartphone data were one of the modalities are accelerometry. The [literature](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26079263) suggests that estimation of energy expenditure is improved if conditioned on physical activity type why a first step was to classify human activity from accelerometer data.

This repo is a compilation of data processing scripts, model definitions and support code to train the models. Dependencies include Theano and Lasagne.
